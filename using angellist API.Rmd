The basics
```{r cars}

library(rjson)

#NOTE rjson's 'fromJSON' method works best for this
#if running jsonlite, may need to detach, and load rjson

url <- 'https://api.angel.co/1/startup_roles?v=1&startup_id=1083851&role=founder&access_token=1be911c0e97dfeffb93e8e113eea82a25f32cf6e415625fc'

test_from_url <- fromJSON(file =url)

```

function outline:

1) get the startup_ids from a data set (probably another dataframe)
2) put all startup_ids in a vector
3) iterate through the vector and save the resultant file to a directory
4) use the algorithm in the "Angel list manipulation JSON.RMD" to iterate through
the directory and load the founders information into a dataframe
